## FIFA Player Database Management System
A menu-driven Python application for managing, analyzing, and visualizing FIFA player data using MySQL and Pandas.
This project focuses on database operations, data analysis, and secure coding practices.
## Project Overview
The FIFA Player Database Management System allows users to:
- View player records stored in a MySQL database
- Insert, update, and delete player data
- Perform basic data analysis using Pandas
- Visualize player data using graphs
- Export the current database state to a CSV file
The project demonstrates Python–MySQL integration, CRUD operations, and data visualization in a structured and modular way.

## 🗂️ Dataset Information

**Source**  
The dataset used in this project was downloaded from :https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/stefanoleone992/fifa-20-complete-player-dataset and is publicly available.

**Note**  
The dataset is **static and not recent**, and may not reflect current FIFA player statistics.  
The primary focus of this project is on **database management, data handling, and application logic**, rather than the timeliness of the data.

The system is **dataset-agnostic** and can be used with any similar FIFA player dataset following the same schema.
